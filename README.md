# Seared Games
We are a community of Christian gamers with a passion for making awesome games that glorify Christ, and, as Elwood Blues so eloquently put it, we're on a mission from God. Our eyes are set on Christ, and sharing His love for YOU with YOU. You are awesome. Jesus loves you. And He will not leave you the way He found you.  Now, let's go have some fun and make something cool for our very best friend.
